## Hooks

Hooks are a new feature proposal that lets you use state and other React features without writing a class.



React needs a better primitive for sharing stateful logic.



You're likely performed data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM from React components before. we call these operations "side effects"(or "effects" for short) because __they can affect other components and can't be done during rendering.__
