### 一些目录

```
The default port has been set in /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf to 8080 so that

nginx will load all files in /usr/local/etc/nginx/servers/

To have launchd start nginx now and restart at login:
  brew services start nginx
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  nginx
  
  
  /usr/local/Cellar/nginx/1.12.2_1
```

### 常见问题

```
mac 安装nginx

brew install nginx

一般出错情况下，执行，，， `brew postinstall nginx`
```

有时候会报一些错误，，，，参考这个网站
